       My name is Sneha Dama and I graduated from the University of Houston in December 2014 with a degree in Supply Chain Management. Upon graduation, I had the wonderful opportunity to work at Fluor Corporation as a Material Management specialist where I was able to showcase my vast skillset as well as learn new programs and network with upper level management.

      <p>
       A few years later, I started researching other fields where I would be a more valuable asset. Creativity, Innovation, and Diligence are three key aspects that I bring into any opportunity, whether it be at school, my job, or my extra curricular activities. Entrepreneurship is a business that I definitely see myself getting into long term in the future. However, at this moment, I am looking for opportunities that enhance my knowledge in all aspects in order to successfully run a business one day.

       A little fun fact about me: Dancing is my passion and I have been a dancer for about 20 years now. I have had some exciting opportunities through dance where I've actually performed for the Houston Rockets half time shows as well as partaken in an Anthony Bourdain -Parts Unkown Houston episode!
